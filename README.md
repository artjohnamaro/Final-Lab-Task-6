# Finals Task 6. MOngoDBCRUD

## Step-By-Step Process
1. Create a Database

Start by creating or switching to a specific database.

The selected database becomes the active workspace for all upcoming operations.

2. Insert Documents

Within the database, a collection is created.

Multiple documents are inserted into the collection, each containing structured data fields such as name, age, or address.

3. FIND Documents

Display all documents stored in the collection.

Use filters to find specific documents based on certain values like name or ID.

4. UPDATE Documents

Locate the document that needs modification using a condition (e.g., name or ID).

Specify the field(s) to be changed and apply the update.

Confirm the update by checking the document again.

5. SEARCH Documents

Use specific criteria to locate documents that match particular conditions (e.g., age greater than a value or status equals a specific string).

Review the matched results for accuracy.

6. DELETE Documents
    
Identify the document(s) to be removed using a condition.

Remove the document(s) from the collection.

Verify deletion by checking the collection contents.
