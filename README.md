# Finals Task 6. MOngoDBCRUD

This portfolio shows about my knowledge in MongoDB CRUD operations, which stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the basic operations used to manage data in a MongoDB database. Through this section, I demonstrate how to perform each of these operations using MongoDBâ€™s methods like insertOne(), find(), updateOne(), and deleteOne(). I also showcase examples using MongoDB with Node.js and explain how data is stored as documents in collections. This reflects my understanding of how MongoDB works in real-world applications, especially for backend development.

## Step-By-Step Process
1. Create a Database

- Start by creating or switching to a specific database.

- The selected database becomes the active workspace for all upcoming operations.

2. Insert Documents

- Within the database, a collection is created.

- Multiple documents are inserted into the collection, each containing structured data fields such as name, age, or address.

3. FIND Documents

- Display all documents stored in the collection.

- Use filters to find specific documents based on certain values like name or ID.

4. UPDATE Documents

- Locate the document that needs modification using a condition (e.g., name or ID).

- Specify the field(s) to be changed and apply the update.

- Confirm the update by checking the document again.

5. SEARCH Documents

- Use specific criteria to locate documents that match particular conditions (e.g., age greater than a value or status equals a specific string).

- Review the matched results for accuracy.

6. DELETE Documents
    
- Identify the document(s) to be removed using a condition.

- Remove the document(s) from the collection.

- Verify deletion by checking the collection contents.

7. RELATIONSHIP

- Insert the following documents into a `users` collection

- Insert the following documents into a `posts` collection

- Insert the following documents into a `comments` collection
